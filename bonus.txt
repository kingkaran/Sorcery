For bonus, we have used Smart pointers in the entire project, and have added colors to the text display.
We have used Shared Pointers as Smart pointers for all the Card type pointers, i.e., for Minions, Spells, Rituals, and Enchantments. By the use of shared pointers, we are able to share the ownership of an object while storing a pointer to another object. Basically, since shared pointers are stack allocated wrapper objects who wrap around pointers, we did not have to worry about deleting the objects, nor we had to keep track of the type of the pointer. Whenever the last shared pointer in memory is destroyed, object wrapping the pointer is also destroyed. Our main reason for using smart pointers is for better memory management.
We have also added different colors to the text display, instead of printing everything in the boring white color. We could achieve this by the use of escaped color codes. Basically, we printed out the color codes before printing out/displaying the cards and the borders in the prompt.cc class. We print the minion cards in Yellow color, enchantment cards in Green, spell cards in hand in Blue, Ritual cards in hand and for player 1 on board in Red, but for player 2 on board in Blue, Graveyard in Red, Name cards and the “SORCERY” in Magenta, and the outer border of the board in Cyan. By using colors or printing the text display, we could make the game more interactive and visually impressive.
